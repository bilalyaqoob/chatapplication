}


npm run watch //starts watch watch changes in src directory and compiles in to dist

npm run build //compiles files from src directory to dist

npm run serve //it is doing watch + start node server, on every file change it will restart node server using nodemon which is watching dist directory changes

Server will run dist/index.js file as main file.
File dist/index.js will be compiled from src/index.js so there should be main file of project.
dist directory should be added to ignore by git ( but not ignore it for npm if it will be a node package )
10.Run server and start creating app in src directory.

npm run serve
